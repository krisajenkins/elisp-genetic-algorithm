* Elisp Genetic Algorithm

Some elisp that uses a genetic algorthim to evolve random strings to
some ideal target. Just for fun.

** Conclusions

I'd say it works pretty well. Strings 'evolve' towards the target
string pretty rapidly. The algorithm can get within one or two steps
of the target string surprisingly quickly. But those last couple of
steps are slow. For small changes, mutation is the only thing that
gets the genes closer, and that's equivalent to random
search.

So, my conclusions are:

- It's surprisingly easy to implement.
- It's a good algorithm for finding a close-enough solution.

In addition, I /suspect/ having a smooth fitness function - one that can
always rank the impact minor changes accurately - is very
important. The nice thing about the string problem is that our fitness
function - levenshtein distance - has a very even path to the goal.
